# Vex

Vex is a fantasy console from an alternate history 1980s where vector graphics remained supreme.  It includes a COBOL-esque programming language (vex)
which compiles to a VM bytecode which drives a virtual vector-based graphics chip.  The project goal is "to compile Asteroids in less than 200 lines", or more
generally, to provide a platform for very easy and rapid development of vector arcade games.

The compiler is currently being written in Kotlin.  The VM hasn't been started but may be written in C++ or D for speed.
